Rules
-----------------

The Throne (center square) and the castles (four corner squares) may only be occupied by the King. 
The King can re-enter the Throne once he leaves it and all men may pass over the empty Throne. 
A castle or an empty Throne is hostile to the enemy. 

> The objective for the King is to escape to a castle. 

The enemy moves first, and then opponents take alternate turns moving a single man. 
All men may move any number of vacant squares along a row or a column, like a rook. 

Men are killed if they are sandwiched between two opposing men, along a column or a row.
The enemy can also be killed if sandwiched between the King or one of his men and a castle or empty Throne.
A man is only killed if the trap is closed by a move of the opponent. 
A killed man is removed from the board. 
The King may take part in kills. 

The King is killed when the enemy surrounds him in all four directions.
