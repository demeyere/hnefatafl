[You Have to Play This 1,600-Year-Old ViKing War Game](https://medium.com/war-is-boring/cef088ae4e2d).



Condensed rules
-----------------

The center square (Throne) and the four corner squares (castles) may only be occupied by the King. 
The King can re-enter the throne, once he leaves it, and all men may pass over the throne when it is empty. 
A castle or an empty Throne is hostile to all men.

> The objective for the King is to escape to a castle. 
> The objective for the enemy is to kill the King. 

The enemy moves first, and then players take alternate turns moving a single man. 
All men may move any number of vacant squares along a row or a column, like a rook. 

Men are killed if they are sandwiched between two opposing men, or between an opposing man and a castle or empty throne, along a column or a row. 
A man is only killed if the trap is closed by a move of the opponent. 
A killed man is removed from the board and is no longer active in the play. 
The King may take part in kills.

The King is killed when the enemy surrounds him in all four directions. 

The game is a draw if neither side can accomplish its objective, or the game starts to loop.
