Rules
-----------------

The Throne (center square) and the castles (four corner squares) may only be occupied by the King. 
The King can re-enter the Throne, once he leaves it, and all men may pass over the Throne when it is empty. 
A castle or an empty Throne is hostile to all men. 

> The objective for the King is to escape to a castle. 
> The objective for the enemy is to kill the King. 

The enemy moves first, and then players take alternate turns moving a single man. 
All men may move any number of vacant squares along a row or a column, like a rook. 

Men are killed if they are sandwiched between two opposing men, or between an opposing man and a castle or empty Throne, along a column or a row. 
A man is only killed if the trap is closed by a move of the opponent. 
A killed man is removed from the board. 
The King may take part in kills. 

The King is killed when the enemy surrounds him in all four directions. 

The game is a draw if neither side can accomplish its objective.
